To interpret user needs I look at what they ask for and ask myself "How do I fufill this need within the software?" I take the answer I come up with and create user stories. User stories are useful for implementing user needs as they tell me what is needed and why, details which help me decide how to best implement ideas and in which order. I will approach developing programs using a few methods I learned in this course. The first will definitely be user stories, as they break down the project into smaller, less overwhelming chunks. Next would be kanban boards or some form of information radiator. This would help me stay organized, which is something I have always struggled with. To be a good team member in software development is to communicate with your team and to work efficiently without compromizing quality for quantity.
